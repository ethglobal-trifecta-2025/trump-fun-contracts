- Minimum bet amount of 1 USD in value
- First-person Trump-style UX/UI

## üìö Technical Stack

- **Network**: Base Sepolia (testnet)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.24
- **Development Framework**: Foundry

## üèóÔ∏è Contract Architecture

The platform consists of several smart contracts that work together:

1. **BettingContract**: Manages prediction markets, handles bet placement, and processes payouts
2. **PointsToken**: ERC20 token used for betting on the platform
3. **TrumpFunPaymaster**: Enables gas fee payment in USDC or PointsToken via ERC-4337 account abstraction

## üìä Deployed Contracts (Base Sepolia)

| Contract | Address | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|

| PointsToken | `0xA373482b473E33B96412a6c0cA8B847E6BBB4D0d` | Native platform token |
| USDC | `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` | USD Coin on Base Sepolia |
| BettingContract | `0x2E180501D3D68241dd0318c68fD9BE0AF1D519a1` | Manages prediction markets |
| TrumpFunPaymaster | `0x9031A3eB126892EE71F8A332feb04Ab1f313aB48` | Enables gas payments in USDC/PointsToken |

## üé≤ Betting Contract Flow

The betting process follows these steps:

1. **Market Creation**
   - Admin creates a new prediction market
   - Sets market parameters (description, expiry, options)
   - Market enters OPEN state

2. **Bet Placement**
   - User approves token spending (USDC/PointsToken)
   - User selects an option and bet amount
   - BettingContract validates:
     - Market is OPEN
     - Bet amount meets minimum (1 USD)
     - User has sufficient balance
   - Bet is recorded and tokens are transferred to contract

3. **Market Resolution**
   - Admin resolves market after expiry or when the action is complete.
   - AI agents sets the winning option
   - Market enters RESOLVED state

4. **Payout Processing**
   - Winners can claim their payouts
   - Payout = (User's bet / Total winning bets) * Total pool
   - Platform fee (3%) is deducted
   - Remaining funds distributed to winners

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/trump-fun-contracts.git
   cd trump-fun-contracts
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your own values
   ```

4. Compile contracts

   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

5. Run tests

   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

### Deploying Contracts

To deploy the TrumpFunPaymaster contract:

```bash
# Load environment variables
source .env

# Deploy the contract
forge script script/EndToEndTest.s.sol --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify --fork-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Using Management Scripts

#### Grading a Pool

To grade a prediction market pool (set the winning option):

```bash
# Grade pool ID 84 with option 0 as the winner
forge script script/GradePoolSimple.s.sol:GradePoolSimpleScript --sig "run(uint256,uint256)" 84 0 --fork-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --chain base-sepolia --broadcast -vvv
```

The first argument is the pool ID, and the second argument is the winning option (0 or 1, or 2 for a draw).

#### Claiming Payouts for a Pool

To claim payouts for all bets in a specific pool:

```bash
# Claim payouts for all bets in pool ID 84
forge script script/ClaimPoolPayouts.s.sol --sig "run(uint256)" 84 --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --chain base-sepolia --broadcast -vvv
```

This script automatically finds all bets in the specified pool and processes their payouts.
